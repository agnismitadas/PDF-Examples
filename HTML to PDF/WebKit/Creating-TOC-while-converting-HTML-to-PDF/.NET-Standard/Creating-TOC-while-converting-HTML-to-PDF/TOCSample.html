<h2 style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Moving
from Spreadsheets to Databases</span></h2>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Word
processing and spreadsheet applications were the engines that drove the
fledgling personal computer market. In the early PC days, WordPerfect and Lotus
1-2-3 dominated the productivity software business. Today, most office workers
use Microsoft Word and Excel on a daily basis. It’s probably a safe bet that
more data is stored in Excel spreadsheets than in all the world’s databases.
It’s an equally good wager that most new Access users have at least
intermediate-level spreadsheet skills, and many qualify as Excel power users.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Excel
2010’s Data ribbon offers elementary database features, such as sorting,
filtering, validation, and data entry forms. You can quickly import and export
data in a variety of formats, including those of database management
applications, such as Access. Excel’s limitations become apparent as your needs
for entering, manipulating, and reporting data grow beyond the spreadsheet’s
basic row-column metaphor. Basically, spreadsheets are list managers; it’s easy
to generate a simple name and address list with Excel. If your needs expand to
contact management and integrating the contact data with other information
generated by your organization, a spreadsheet isn’t the optimal approach.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The first
problem arises when your contacts list needs additional rows for multiple
persons from a single company. You must copy or retype all the company
information, which generates redundant data. If the company moves, you must
search and replace every entry for your contacts at the firm with the new
address. If you want to record a history of dealings with a particular
individual, you add pairs of date and text columns for each important contact
with the person. Eventually, you find yourself spending more time navigating
the spreadsheet’s rows and columns than using the data they contain.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Contact
lists are only one example of problems that arise when attempting to make
spreadsheets do the work of databases. Tracking medical or biological research
data, managing consulting time and billings, organizing concert tours, booking
artist engagements, and myriad other complex processes are far better suited to
database than spreadsheet applications.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Moving to
a relational database management system (RDBMS), such as Access, solves data
redundancy and navigation problems and greatly simplifies updating existing
information. After you understand the basic rules of relational database
design, Access makes creating highly efficient databases quick and easy. Access
2010 has a collection of wizards to lead you step-by-step through each process
involved in developing and using a production-grade database application.
Unfortunately, no “Relational Wizard” exists to design the underlying database
structure for you, but you’ll find a wealth of pre-built database templates in
the Backstage page’s New tab. (Click the ribbon’s File tab to open the new
Backstage page.)</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Tip</span></strong></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>If your
goal is learning relational database fundamentals, start with Access 2010.
Access is by far the first choice of universities, colleges, trade schools, and
computer-training firms for courses ranging from introductory data management
to advanced client/server database programming. The reason for Access’s
popularity as a training platform is its unique combination of initial ease of
use and support for advanced database application development techniques</span></p>

<h2 style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Reliving
Database History</span></h2>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Databases
form the foundation of world commerce and knowledge distribution. Without
databases, there would be no World Wide Web, automatic teller machines,
credit/debit cards, or online airline reservation systems. Newsgathering
organizations, research institutions, universities, and libraries would be
unable to categorize and selectively disseminate their vast store of current
and historical information. It’s difficult to imagine today a world without a
network of enormous databases, many of which probably contain a substantial
amount of your personal data that you don’t want to be easily available to
others.</span></p>

<h3 style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The Early
History of Databases</span></h3>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The forerunner
of today’s databases consisted of stacks of machine-readable punched cards,
which Herman Hollerith used to record the 1890 U.S. census. Hollerith formed
the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, which later became International
Business Machines. From 1900 to the mid-1950s, punched cards were the primary
form of business data storage and retrieval, and IBM was the primary supplier
of equipment to combine and sort (collate) punched cards, and print reports
based on punched-card data.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The
development of large computer-maintained databases—originally called
databanks—is a post–World War II phenomenon. Mainframes replaced punched cards
with high-capacity magnetic tape drives to store large amounts of data. The
first databases were built on the hierarchical and network models, which were
well suited to the mainframe computers of the 1950s. Hierarchical databases use
parent-child relationships to define data structures, whose diagrams resemble
business organization charts or an inverted tree with its root at the top of
the hierarchy. Network databases allow relaxation of the rules of hierarchical
data structures by defining additional relationships between data items.
Hierarchical and network databases ordinarily are self-contained and aren’t
easy to link with other external databases over a network.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Early
databases used batch processing for data entry and retrieval. Keypunch
operators typed data from documents, such as incoming orders. At night, other
operators collated the day’s batch of punched cards, updated the information
stored on magnetic tape, and produced reports. Many smaller merchants continue
to use batch processing of customer’s credit-card purchases, despite the
availability of terminals that permit almost instantaneous processing of
credit- and debit-card transactions.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Note</span></strong></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Hierarchical
databases remain alive and well in the twenty-first century. For example, data
storage for Windows 2000’s Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange Server is
derived from the hierarchical version of Access’s original relational Jet
databases. The name Jet comes from the original Access database engine called
Joint Engine Technology.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The
Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) is a collection of hierarchical databases
for translating character-based Internet domain names into numerical Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. The DNS database is called a distributed database,
because its data is held by a global network of thousands of computers.</span></p>

<h3 style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The
Relational Database Model</span></h3>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Dr. E. F.
Codd, an employee of IBM Corporation, published “A Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Databanks” in a journal of the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM) in June 1970. A partial copy of the paper is available at
http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/. Dr. Codd’s specialty was a branch of mathematics
called set theory, which includes the concept of relations. He defined a
relation as a named set of tuples (records or rows) that have attributes
(fields or columns). One of the attributes must contain a unique value to
identify each tuple. The common term for relation is a table whose presentation
to the user is similar to that of a spreadsheet.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Relational
databases solve a serious problem associated with earlier database types.
Hierarchical and network databases define sets of data and explicit links
between each data set as parent-child and owner-member, respectively. To
extract information from these databases, programmers had to know the structure
of the entire database. Complex programs in COBOL or other mainframe computer
languages are needed to navigate through the hierarchy or network and extract
information into a format understandable by users.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Dr.
Codd’s objective was to simplify the process of extracting formatted
information and make adding or altering data easier by eliminating complex
navigational programming. During the 1970s, Dr. Codd and others developed a
comparatively simple language, Structured Query Language (SQL), for creating,
manipulating, and retrieving relational data. With a few hours of training,
ordinary database users could write SQL statements to define simple information
needs and bypass the delays inherent in the database programming process. SQL,
which was first standardized in 1985, now is the lingua franca of database
programming, and all commercial database products support SQL.</span></p>

<h3 style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Client/Server
and Desktop RDBMSs</span></h3>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>In the
early database era, the most common presentation of data took the form of
lengthy reports processed by centralized, high-speed impact printers on
fan-folded paper. The next step was to present data to the user on green-screen
video terminals, often having small printers attached, which were connected to
mainframe databases. As use of personal computers gained momentum, terminal
emulator cards enabled PCs to substitute for mainframe terminals. Mainframe-scale
relational databases, such as IBM’s DB2, began to supplement and later replace
hierarchical and network databases, but terminals continued to be the primary
means of data entry and retrieval.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Note</span></strong></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The most
widely used SQL standard, SQL-92, was published by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1992. Few, if any, commercial relational database
management systems (RDBMSs) today fully conform to the entire SQL-92 standard.
The later SQL-99 (also called SQL3) and SQL-200n specifications add new
features that aren’t germane to Access databases.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>RDBMS
competitors have erected an SQL Tower of Babel by adding nonstandard extensions
to the language. For example, Microsoft’s Transact-SQL (T-SQL) for SQL Server,
which is the subject of Chapter 27, “Moving from Access Queries to
Transact-SQL,” has many proprietary keywords and features. Oracle Corporation’s
Oracle:SQL and PL/SQL dialects also have proprietary SQL extensions.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Oracle,
Ingres, Informix, Sybase, and other software firms developed relational
databases for lower-cost minicomputers, most of which ran various flavors of
the UNIX operating system. Terminals continued to be the primary data entry and
display systems for multiuser UNIX databases.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>The next
step was the advent of early PC-based flat-file managers and relational
database management systems. Early flat-file database managers, typified by Jim
Button’s PCFile for DOS (1981) and Claris FileMaker for Macintosh (1988) and
Windows (1992), used a single table to store data and offered few advantages
over storing data in a spreadsheet. The early desktop RDBMSs—such as dBASE,
Clipper, FoxBase, and Paradox—ran under DOS and didn’t support SQL. These
products later became available in multiuser versions, adopted SQL features,
and eventually migrated to Windows. Access 1.0, which Microsoft introduced in
November 1992, rapidly eclipsed its DOS and Windows competitors by virtue of
Access’s combination of graphical SQL support, versatility, and overall ease of
use.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>PC-based
desktop RDBMSs are classified as shared-file systems because they store their
data in conventional files that multiple users can share on a network. One of
Access’s initial attractions for users and developers was its capability to
store all application objects—forms, reports, and programming code—and tables
for a database application in a single file, which used the earlier .mdb
extension.. FoxPro, dBASE, Clipper, and Paradox require a multitude of
individual files to store application and data objects. Today, almost every multiuser
Access application is divided (split) into a front-end .accdb file, which
contains application objects and links to a back-end database .accdb file that
holds the data. Each user has a copy of the front-end .accdb file and shares
connections to a single back-end .accdb file on a peer Windows workstation or
server.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Note</span></strong></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Prior to
Access 2000, Jet was Access’s standard database engine, so the terms Access
database and Jet database were interchangeable. Microsoft considered SQL Server
to be its strategic RDBMS for Access 2000 and 2003. Strategic means that SQL
Server gets continuing development funds and Jet doesn’t. Jet 4.0, which was
included with Access 2003 and is a part of the Windows XP and later operating
systems, is the final version and is headed toward retirement.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Microsoft’s
Access team decided to enhance Jet 4.0 with the new features described in
Chapter 1, “Access 2010 for Access 2007 Users: What’s New,” change the file
extension from .mdb to .accdb, and drop all references to Jet. To reflect this
change, this edition uses the terms Access database and SQL Server database.
Unless otherwise noted, SQL Server refers to all SQL Server 2005 editions
except the Compact and Mobile editions.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Client/server
RDBMSs have an architecture similar to Access’s front-end/back-end shared-file
multiuser configuration. What differentiates client/server from shared-file
architecture is that the RDBMS on the server handles most of the
data-processing activity. The client front end provides a graphical user
interface (GUI) for data entry, display, and reporting. Only SQL statements and
the specific data requested by the user pass over the network. Client/server
databases traditionally run on network operating systems, such as Windows and
UNIX, and are much more robust than shared-file databases, especially for
applications in which many users make simultaneous additions, changes, and
deletions to the database. All commercial data-driven Web applications use
client/server databases.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><strong><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Note</span></strong></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>This book
uses the terms field and record when referring to tables, and columns and rows
when discussing data derived from tables, such as the views and query result
sets described later in this chapter.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Since
version 1.0, Access has had the capability to connect to client/server
databases by linking their tables to an Access database. Linking lets you treat
client/server tables almost as if they were native Access tables. Linking uses
Microsoft’s widely accepted Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) standard, and
Access 2010 includes an ODBC driver for SQL Server and Oracle databases. You
can purchase licenses for ODBC drivers that support other UNIX or Windows
RDBMSs, such as Sybase or Informix, from the database supplier or third
parties. Chapter 19, “Linking Access Front Ends to Access and Client/Server
Databases,” describes the process of linking Access and Microsoft SQL Server
2008 databases. Although Chapter 19 uses SQL Server for its examples, the
linking procedure is the same for—or at least similar to—other client/server
RDBMSs.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:black'>Access data
projects (ADP) and the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition combine to
make Access 2010 a versatile tool for designing and testing client/server
databases and creating advanced data entry and reporting applications. You can
start with a conventional Access database and later use Access’s Upsizing
Wizard to convert the .mdb file(s) to an .adp file that holds application
objects and an SQL Server 2005 back-end database. Access 2010’s Upsizing Wizard
has incorporated many improvements to the Access 2000 and earlier wizard
versions, but Access 2010’s Wizard is the same as 2007’s. Despite the upgraded
wizardry, you’re likely to need to make changes to queries to accommodate
differences between Access and SQL Server’s SQL dialects.</span></p>
